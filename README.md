# Node-Oauth2-Express-Server

Hii Everyone,
If you are familiar to Nodejs or Javascript (ofcourse thats why you are here). You know that for authentication we use JWT token and then check that token for identifying that the user is valid or not.

**But wait...** is this the only scenerio??
### No

Today there are many ways to authorize and authenticate the user. One of them is Oauth2 that is used for third party login like **login to Google** and **login to Facebook**.
The way this third party login works is first the Google or any thirs party server provide the authentication code to the first party and then that first party again send that authentication code to the third party server. Now that server revert back to clientId and secretId that is passed with our credentials.
